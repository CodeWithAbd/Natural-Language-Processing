    "# Concept of Count-Vectorizer and why it is used? in Bag of words:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Count-Vectorizer is a feature extraction method used in natural language processing (NLP) and other text-based data analysis tasks.\n",
    "# The goal of this method is to convert a collection of documents into a numerical representation.\n",
    "# That representations can be used as input to machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic idea behind Count-Vectorizer is to take a set of documents and represent each document as a vector of word counts.\n",
    "# Where each element in the vector corresponds to the number of times a particular word occurs in the document.\n",
    "# This representation is often referred to as a \"bag of words\" representation.\n",
    "# Because the order of the words in the document is not taken into account.\n",
    "# For BOW and the only information retained is the frequency of occurrence of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Count-Vectorizer is widely used in NLP because it is simple to implement, easy to interpret.\n",
    "# It can be used with a variety of algorithms,including those based on linear models, trees, and neural networks.\n",
    "# Additionally, it can handle text data that contains different levels of noise, such as misspelled words,\n",
    "# non-standard word forms, and stop words.\n",
    "\n",
    "# One potential drawback of using Count-Vectorizer is that it can lead to very high-dimensional representations.\n",
    "# especially when working with large corpora of text data.\n",
    "# This can result in the curse of dimensionality, where the number of features exceeds the number of instances.\n",
    "# This may lead to poor performance of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "# To mitigate this problem, various feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques can be applied."
